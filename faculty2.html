        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Dr. Md. Khalilur Rahman is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Department of BRAC University. He was the principal investigator of Nation’s first Nano-satellite program which is named as “BRAC ONNESHA” by BRAC University. He was assigned as the Acting Chairman of CSE department from 1st Sep-14 to 31st Dec-2014. He is the founder of Nano-Satellite Technology Research (NASTER) Lab, BRAC University Robotics lab and the founder advisor of BRAC University Robotics club. The robot named CHONDROBOT, MONGOL-TORI and BRACU-DUBURI was designed and built under his peer supervision. Different versions of these Robots are regularly attending in different international competitions such as NASA Lunabotic Mining Competition USA, University Rover Challenge USA, Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Competition etc. Dr. Khalil has joined in BRAC University on 2009 immediately after completing his PhD degree from Kyushu Institute of Technology, Japan and promoted as associate professor on 2013. He was a MONBUKAGAKUSHO scholar and his PhD Research topic was Natural Language Processing. But now his research is diverted into Space Science & Engineering, Robotics and Embedded Systems. He was born on 1976 in a river bank city Sirajganj of Bangladesh. After completing his Secondary and Higher Secondary Schooling he took admission in Institute of Science and Technology under National University for graduation and post-graduation degrees. Dr. Khalil became point of contact (POC) of UNISEC-Global (University Space Engineering Consortium) on 2014.
